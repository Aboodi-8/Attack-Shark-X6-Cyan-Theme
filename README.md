### Attack Shark X6 Custom Software Skin

This is a fan-made custom skin for the **Attack Shark X6** mouse software. I created this to give the software a fresh, modern look, and Iâ€™m sharing it for those who want to try it out. Please note that this is an unofficial modification, and I am not affiliated with **Attack Shark** in any way. This project was made purely out of passion, and I was not compensated for it.

#### Features:
- **Color Theme**: Changed the overall software color scheme from red to cyan for a cooler, more modern look.
- **Battery Icon**: Updated the battery icon to match the new cyan theme.
- **Icons**: All icons in the software have been changed from red to cyan.
- **Window Controls**: Modified the close and minimize buttons to better suit the new theme.
- **Connection Mode Icons**: Updated the icons for connection modes to fit the cyan theme.
- **Background**: Changed the software background color from a dark cyan-blue shade to a sleek black.
- **Software & Tray Icon**: Updated the software's main icon and the tray icon to match the new design.
